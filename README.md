I have used Kotin with MVVM architecture & following frameworks to complete the task:

Retrofit 2,
Dagger 2,
RxJava.
Live Data & ViewModel,
Glide,
RecyclerView,
Cardview,

I have used progress bar to show loading content and optionally I've used Glide framework to load images on the list. Further, I've creted an empty activity to open on list item click. Finally I wrote simple unit tests as I don't know what to test on the view. (I've attached screenshots of the app)

If I missed anything please do let me know
